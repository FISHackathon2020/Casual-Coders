## General Purpose
```

The purpose of our project is to creating a dating app style job matching system that will allow 
users to search for jobs, apply for jobs, and to use the interface like a tinder profile to match a job description based on skills to remove the bias in society.

The recruiter side will allow to reject or accept a applicant and if both sides match, an interview can be placed via the app.


```
### Core implementation
```
Have video chatting to interact with a recruiter
Scale the app to be increased to a much larger size (Hold 10k users at the very least)
To create revenue, we can add a promotion which will allow job seekers to see a promoted job 

```
- [x] Create a wireframe using Adobe XD
- [x] Set-up system to use flutter in Android Studio
- [?] Build the back-end system 
```
This can be improved by adding a login screen, more targeted fields, and many other things to get the system running to help students match to a certain scope that they are interested in.

- We gave our final product as an android app as we were not familiar with many of the tools we were using, but we managed to get a skeleton version of what we wanted. We are pleased with the outcome, but we know there could be more done with this platform.
