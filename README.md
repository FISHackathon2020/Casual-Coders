The purpose of our project is to creating a dating app style job matching system that will allow 
users to search for jobs, apply for jobs, and to use the interface like a tinder profile to match a job description.

The recruiter side will allow to reject or accept a applicant and if both sides match, an interview can be placed.


```


- [x] Create a wireframe using Adobe XD
- [x] Set-up system to use flutter in Android Studio
- [N] Build the back-end system 

```
This can be improved by adding a login screen, more targeted fields, and many other things to get the system running to help students match to a certain scope that they are interested in.

- We gave our final product as an android app as we were not familiar with many of the tools we were using, but we managed to get a skeleton version of what we wanted. We are pleased with the outcome, but we know there could be more done with this platform.
